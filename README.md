# cross-runtime-JS

Template/Info for publishing JS/TS libraries for Node.js, Deno, and Bun. Sets up

### How to use

- Replace all occurences of `__NAME_HERE__` with your library name.
- `runtime-helper.ts` defines `getRuntimeName()` that returns a string based on the runtime (`"bun" | "deno" | "deno-unstable" | "node"`)

### TODO

- Github Actions
- Scripts for publishing/tasks
- More info for jsr
- Other stuf from [Tuplite](https://github.com/blobbybilb/Tuplite/)
